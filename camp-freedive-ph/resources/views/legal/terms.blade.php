                            Participants are responsible for determining whether they are physically capable of participating in freediving and related activities. Camp Freedive PH does not require a physician’s medical clearance unless otherwise specifically requested based on the circumstances of a participant or activity.

                            Freediving activities take place in an outdoor marine environment and may be affected by weather, tides, waves, currents, rainfall, wind, visibility, and other environmental conditions.
                        </p>
