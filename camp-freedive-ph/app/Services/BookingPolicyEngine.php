/**
 * Booking Policy & Penalty Calculation Engine.
 *
 * Operational & Business Context:
 * Evaluates dynamic guest reschedule and cancellation eligibility based on lead time
 * to the dive weekend and active maritime force majeure conditions (e.g., PAGASA Typhoon
 * Signals, PCG Gale Warnings).
 *
 * Financial & Marine Safety Rationale:
 * 1. Force Majeure: 100% full downpayment refund or free reschedule granted immediately
 *    to protect diver safety and comply with Philippine Coast Guard advisory orders.
 * 2. > 14 Days Out: 100% refund or free reschedule allowed as resort slots and outrigger
 *    bancas can still be re-allocated to waitlisted divers.
 * 3. 7 to 14 Days Out: Rescheduling is free, but cancellation forfeits downpayment (0% refund)
 *    to offset committed resort room reservations.
 * 4. < 7 Days Out: Reschedule locked out and downpayment forfeited because instructor payroll,
 *    boat fuel, and gear transport are non-refundable and committed.
