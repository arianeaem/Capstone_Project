"""
Builds lagged and rolling historical features for multi-step-ahead forecasting.

Features:
- RAW_VARS at LAG_HOURS [0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48]
  (0 = current observed value at time t; 1..48 = historical lags)
- Trailing 24h rolling statistics (mean, std, min, max) computed on .shift(1)
  so that rolling stats cover t-1 back to t-24 without touching t itself.

# forecasting t+H for any H >= 1. Omitting it would handicap the model
# relative to the persistence baseline it's required to beat in Step 4 —
# persistence IS essentially "just use lag=0," so the model needs access to
# that same information at minimum to have a fair chance of doing better.
